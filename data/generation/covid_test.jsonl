The mayors of Edwardsville, Glen Carbon and Maryville all read Radon Action Month proclamations this month as Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) reminds residents to get their homes tested for radon.   Radon is a by-product emitted by naturally-decaying uranium in the soil. You can't see, smell or taste this radioactive gas. Radon levels in Madison County are in the 3.8-4 parts per picocuries per liter of air (pCi/L) range.   According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), radon is the No. 1 cause of lung cancer among non-smokers and overall, the second leading cause of lung cancer. Radon is responsible for 21,000 lung cancer deaths annually. Almost 3,000 of those 21,000 deaths occurred in individuals who never smoked tobacco.   Amy Yeager, director of community health for the Madison County Health Department, said they sold 243 radon kits last year.   \"With radon having such a large impact on lung cancer rates, it's really important for people to get their homes tested,\" Yeager said.    What citizens should do    The first step is to get your home tested for radon. Testing kits are available at local hardware and big-box stores for not a lot of money. If the test results reveal that you have a level of four pCi/L or more of radon at home, you need to fix your home.   If you rent a home, apartment or townhouse, and you want to test your unit for radon, Yeager says there are certain steps to follow. If the rental has been tested for radon, the owner is required to inform the renter in writing that a radon hazard may exist. If the rental has not been tested, the renter may test for radon themselves or ask the owner to test.   IEMA...", "keyword": "None"}

(AP) - Veteran defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has been fired by the Los Angeles Rams after three winning seasons.   Phillips announced Monday on Twitter that the Rams are not renewing his contract, and the team later confirmed it. The 72-year-old former head coach of a record six NFL teams says he wants to stay in coaching.   The Rams finished 9-7 this season, missing the playoffs for the first time in Phillips' three-year partnership with Sean McVay. Although Phillips' distinctive 3-4 defense led by Aaron Donald again finished near the top of the NFL in many advanced metrics this season, McVay has decided to shake up his coaching staff for a third consecutive offseason.   McVay offered no reasoning for his decision in a brief statement issued through the team.   \"Coach Wade has been a veteran voice in heading our defense for the past three seasons,\" McVay said. \"His wealth of experience, sound advice, and helpful demeanor has been invaluable to our coaches and players, and also has set an example for me as a head coach and a leader of men.\"   The Rams also fired veteran running backs coach Skip Peete, who had been with the franchise since before McVay and Phillips arrived.   Phillips and the offense-minded McVay joined the Rams together in 2017, with the veteran coordinator serving as an experienced counterpoint and adviser to the youngest head coach in modern NFL history. McVay, then 30 years old, asked Phillips to join him in Los Angeles before he even got the job.   The duo engineered a stunning one-season turnaround of the Rams, who had endured 13 consecutive non-winning seasons and a 12-year playoff drought. While McVay put immediately together a prolific offense, Phillips ran a defense that eventually backstopped the Rams to 33...", "keyword": "None"}

But the Army vet has still shared some precious moments with his grandmother over the years! Last year, Prince Charles\u2019 former butler, Grant Harrold, spoke about the queen\u2019s \u201cvery special relationship\u201d with her grandson in a Quest Red royal documentary. Harrold said that the queen is able to \u201clet her guard down a bit with\u201d Harry. \u201cSometimes, I wonder if maybe he reminds the Queen a little bit of [her husband] Prince Philip,\u201d Harrold continued. \u201cYou know, with that wonderful, let\u2019s say, the kind of glint in his eye.\u201d Royal correspondent Katie Nicholl gave an inside look at Harry\u2019s relationship with Queen Elizabeth in her 2010 book, William and Harry: Behind the Palace Walls. Nicholl revealed that the monarch has been \u201con the receiving end\u201d of Harry\u2019s pranks. She was informed about a prank Harry pulled that involved changing her voicemail recording, giving the queen\u2019s private secretary Robin Janvrin the \u201cshock of his life.\u201d Harry, who Nicholl described as \u201cmore troublesome\u201d than his brother Prince William, said in the recorded voice message: \u201cHey, wassup? This is Liz! Sorry, I\u2019m away from the throne. For a hotline to Philip, press one, for Charles press two, for the corgis, press three.\u201d In the 2016 ITV documentary, Our Queen at Ninety, Harry praised the queen for her work over the years. \u201cI look at the Commonwealth and think, \u2018Look how much it\u2019s achieved,\u2019\u201d he said at the time. \u201cShe should be incredibly proud of what she\u2019s led and what she\u2019s achieved and what she\u2019s created amongst a huge amount of people from different ethnic backgrounds, different skin colors, different experiences, different islands \u2014 whatever it be.

The freshman class decorated its hall according to the theme of Chutes and Ladders. The sophomore class did its hall up to represent The Game of Life. The juniors went with a Monopoly design and the seniors chose Candy Land.   Senior Jackie Guigar helped to design paper cutouts and the ginger bread man for her class's Candy Land theme. Showing participation, Guigar sported a tie dye ensemble made complete with a tutu and cape. She spoke on what the week means to her.   \"This is my last year here,\" Guigar said. \"After graduation who is going to remember me? This is a way for me to get involved.\"   History teacher Kevin Parker functions as the school's student council coordinator and manages the spirit week activities with his students. Parker chose to get actively involved with the student body to promote school spirit. He explained that every class is given a day during the week to host an hour-long assembly. During each assembly, a king and queen is nominated for the day.   On Tuesday, sophomores were loud and in charge. They came together to create several fun relay races involving scooters and bouncing balls into cups strapped around their foreheads.

They are almost always too something - too sweet, too pasty, too artificial-tasting. But, because bars are the ultimate on-the-go nourishment, like just about everyone else in America (judging from the endless number of bar options at the grocery store), I couldn't live without them. So I started making my own.   Over the years, I've played with variations: some cakier, some chewier, trying out different fruits and nuts, and they have always been worth the little effort it takes to make them. The bars are gently, rather than overly, sweet and the flavor of whole, quality ingredients shines. You can taste that they are freshly made, even when thawed from frozen. (I usually wrap the bars individually in wax paper and put them in a resealable freezer bag).   In the past, I had always sweetened my bars with either maple syrup or honey, included some kind of grain and used egg as a binder, but here I took a shot, using only nuts, seeds and dried fruit, and it seems I scored a big hit. Everyone who has tried them loves them! With no added sugar, the bars get their sweetness from dried dates; almond meal becomes the flour; and \"chia eggs\" (chia seeds soaked in water until thickened) act as a binder.   The bars are slightly chewy with a nutty crunch, and the simple goodness of their ingredients really comes through. I must warn you though, once you try them, you might never want a packaged one again.   - - -   FRUIT AND NUT ENERGY BARS   Active: 20 minutes | Total: 40 minutes   18 Servings   These bars - made with dried fruits, nuts and seeds, and with no flour, egg or added sugars - are slightly chewy, with nutty crunch and the lovely flavors of the whole, simple ingredients.

Damian Garrett appeared before Judge Stephen Carras on Thursday morning for plea cut-off hearing. At the hearing, Garrett chose to waive a plea offer from Midland County Prosecuting Attorney J. Dee Brooks, meaning the case will go to trial at a later date.   Garrett faces charges of felony-murder and first degree child abuse stemming from the Sept. 17 death of Skylar Papple. Garrett, who was in a dating relationship with the toddler's mother, Emma Buchholz, at the time of the incident, was arrested two days later.   The prosecution's offer included a minimum sentence of 30 years in prison - with the maximum terms to either be agreed upon between parties or set by the court - if Garrett entered a \"guilty\" plea on the amended charges of second-degree murder and first-degree child abuse.   According to Michigan Legislature, both charges of carry a penalty of imprisonment for life or any term of years decided by the court. Garrett is represented by attorney Dan Duke.   Carras said the trial dates will be set \"right away.\"   According to an affidavit from Garrett's arraignment, Midland County Central Dispatch responded to an emergency call for medical assistance just after 3 p.m. Sept. 17 at Northwind Forest Apartments, located at 5220 Hedgewood Dr.   Midland Fire Department and emergency medical service personnel made contact with an apartment manager, who was helping perform CPR on the toddler, the affidavit reads.

He sent me to a cardiologist, who did a blood test and told me that I\u2019d had a mild heart attack! An echocardiogram confirmed it. I never felt any chest pain, so how is this possible? Selma K., Montgomery, Ala. A: You\u2019re a lucky woman. You lived through a heart attack. Now, take advantage of that luck and reduce your risk for another, far more serious one. Many people who have a so-called silent heart attack don\u2019t recognize the signs because symptoms mimic everything from the flu to fatigue \u2014 or there are none at all! That means many folks don\u2019t follow up with a doctor like you did, to figure out what\u2019s not quite right. Now that you know you had a silent heart attack, you can get on top of your heart health by learning to manage stress and exercising regularly. You\u2019ll also want to ditch all ultra-processed foods, red meat, egg yolks and simple sugars; don\u2019t smoke anything; and get seven to eight hours of quality sleep nightly. Doing cardio rehab and seeing your cardiologist regularly are also essential. You may start taking medications like statins, co-Q10, low-dose aspirin and/or blood pressure medications, if prescribed. By being conscientious about taking care of yourself, you may save yourself from a not-so-silent second heart attack! But don\u2019t feel badly about missing your heart attack when it happened! A recent study found that 47 percent of Americas aren\u2019t familiar with at least some of the symptoms of a not-so-silent heart attack. So let\u2019s review: The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort. Sometimes that\u2019s accompanied by a cold...", "keyword": "None"}

So far just $15 million has been mobilized to help stop the outbreak that threatens to worsen an already poor hunger situation for millions of people in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and elsewhere, Dominique Bourgeon, emergencies director with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, told a briefing in Rome.   \"You can imagine that a country that has not seen such a thing in 70 years is not well prepared,\" he said of Kenya, East Africa's economic hub.   The outbreak, blamed in part on a changing climate, now threatens to spread to South Sudan and Uganda, and new rains in the weeks to come will fuel fresh vegetation and a new wave of breeding. The outbreak might not be under control until June, when drier weather arrives, authorities have said.   But by then the number of locusts, if left unchecked, could grow 500 times, experts have warned.   \"If after April the money has come, it's somehow useless,\" FAO chief Qu Dongyu told the briefing. \"So the timing, location, is crucial.\"   Already the locusts, moving in swarms of hundreds of millions, have stripped some crops bare. An Ethiopian representative at the briefing told the FAO that some farmers in Africa's second most populous nation have lost 90% of their production.   The locusts have been moving steadily toward Ethiopia's Rift Valley, the country's breadbasket, the United Nations says.   Authorities have said aerial pesticide spraying is the only effective control in the outbreak, but officials in Kenya and elsewhere have said more planes and more pesticide are needed.

Jimmie Tiger, 32, was arrested Jan. 19 following an investigation by Pleasant Hill police detectives and a review of the case by the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office. He was then taken into custody, police said.   The altercation happened on Jan. 11 in front of the Target store on Contra Costa Boulevard in Pleasant Hill, police said.   The 52-year-old man in the wheelchair confronted a driver who parked in a space that required a blue and white disabled person parking placard. The victim then went into the Target store to ask that police be called, police Sgt. Ron Priebe said.   The suspect, later identified as Tiger, then found and approached the victim inside the store and demanded that he go back outside and apologize to his wife, the driver, for the altercation.   The victim refused, and Tiger then tried to forcibly wheel him outside. When the victim resisted, Tiger violently lifted the victim's wheelchair and spilled the man onto the floor, Priebe said.   Police said witnesses tended to the victim, who was injured and received medical attention. Detectives were given a partial license plate number for Tiger's vehicle, and later identified the car and their suspect.   Pleasant Hill detectives presented the case to the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office, and on Jan. 17 charges of attempted kidnapping and assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury were filed and an arrest warrant was issued.

(AP) - A judge has sentenced a Colorado woman to 14 years in prison for the role she played in the death of her almost two-year-old son in 2018.   Faith Hughes, 22, was sentenced this week and is being credited for 560 days she already served in county jail, The Pueblo Chieftain reported Monday.   Hughes was also fined more than $1,400, a judge said.   Hughes pleaded guilty in December to negligence causing death, prosecutors said. She was originally charged with child abuse resulting in death, prosecutors said.   The plea deal stipulated that Hughes would be sentenced to serve a prison term of no more than 16 years at the Colorado Department of Corrections, prosecutors said.   Hughes and 22-year-old father Skyler Chapman were arrested in June 2018 after Hughes brought their son to a hospital with severe injuries including two bleeding brain injuries and black eyes, authorities said.   Hughes originally said she and the boy were assaulted by strangers before changing her story saying she and Chapman commonly hit the child as a form of discipline, authorities said.   Chapman denied striking the child with his hand but instead described kicking the child who landed on his head.   Chapman was sentenced to 48 years in September after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.", "keyword": "None"}

Jerseyville Public Works Director Bob Manns said the project - stretching from Fulkerson Drive to Crystal Lake Road - was long-needed. He said core samples by the Illinois Department of Transportation revealed in late 2019 that the road conditions were sub-par.   \"The fact is, this has been needed for a long time,\" Manns said. \"Hopefully no one is in here to debate whether or not the road surface needs to be replaced; it definitely does.\"   The project also would address safety concerns on U.S. 67 in Jerseyville, Manns said, adding that the best option would be to convert from angle parking to parallel parking and adding a bi-directional turn lane.   The Illinois Department of Transportation needs to have a plan prepared by March to meet its June bid-letting schedule, Manns said. Construction could start in August.   \"We can work with them on things like schedule and start dates,\" Manns said. \"We can work with them to say things like, 'Can you start in this segment?' or 'Don't shut down a five-block corridor.'\"   The plan is what the Illinois Department of Transportation calls a \"Band-Aid\" solution, he said, providing a five- to 15-year solution until the state can do a complete reconstruction of U.S. 67.   Jerseyville council member Nick Bexheti, in charge of streets and public improvements, assured people he and Manns were listening to everyone's thoughts about the work.   \"We're not going to work against the business owners and the city,\" Bexheti said.   Beth Bear, director of the Jersey County Business Association, said she had polled 54 businesses about their support of the plan and found 28 opposed it....", "keyword": "None"}

Students perform well above the U.S. average and do better even than their peers in similarly wealthy school districts, a study found.   At no point in recent memory has Melrose Public Schools been failing. But the outgoing superintendent, Cyndy Taymore, is four years into an effort to fundamentally rethink traditional schooling here.   The model is known by several names, including proficiency-based education. That's what they called it in Maine, where in 2012, state officials mandated that every district adopt it, and then in 2018, abandoned the requirement. The state's boomerang confirmed for many critics that proficiency-based education was a failure. But for Taymore, it proved only that Maine went about it all wrong.   In Melrose, they're calling it competency-based education, and it's moving full steam ahead.   Competency-based education demands a shift away from traditional teaching, testing and grading. Students get more control over what and how they learn and take more responsibility for their progress. Teachers define what competencies students should master and support them toward proficiency, even if it takes a while. Teachers also change their grading policies. Students don't get extra points for doing homework or participating in class. Competency-based education demands that teachers separate \"habits of learning\" from academic achievement.   Last year, Melrose served about 3,900 students. Among them, just under 12 percent came from economically disadvantaged families, slightly more had some type of learning disability, and 4 percent were English-language learners. These groups historically lag behind their peers in test performance. Taymore believes...", "keyword": "None"}

In 1955, a play debuted, based on that trial, which pitted attorneys Clarence Darrow against William Jennings Bryan. Alton Little Theater is bringing this story to the stage.   \"Inherit the Wind,\" a drama written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, opens Jan. 31. The play is based on an issue that is as relevant today as it was in the 1920s, because this moving and meaningful production is, at heart, addressing the freedoms of every American, said the Alton Little Theater (ALT) production's director, Lee Cox.   And because she didn't want the play to come across as \"preachy\" or to extoll politic views, she knew she had to find a balance and a vision of why seeing great plays that make people think - really think - is so important from time to time.   \"I hardly ever do revivals,\" Cox said, \"and I don't think most plays have the mettle to stand the test of time, for we move so fast as a society to different humors and sensibilities.   \"But every once in a while, there is just good writing that does stand as a beacon to reread and reperform, and 'Inherit the Wind' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird' are perfect examples for me.\"   The story fictionalizes the legal case in which a high school teacher, John T. Scopes, was accused of violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which made it unlawful to teach human evolution in any state-funded school. The trial set modernists, who said evolution was not inconsistent with religion, against fundamentalists, who said the word of God, as revealed in the Bible, took priority over all human knowledge. The case was viewed as both a theological contest and a trial on whether modern science should be taught in schools.   The playwrights said at the time that it was...", "keyword": "None"}

Closer to home, it's put a renewed focus on the Fifth District congressional race, where Hyde calls himself a candidate even as virtually no Republicans claimed to know anything about him.   Whether that would matter is an open question. It's not hard to imagine an otherwise unknown candidate who seems to have entree to the highest levels of Trumpworld - see his selfies with the president and members of his inner circle - could ride that notoriety to a primary victory. The rules changed in 2016, and it would be na\u00efve to think a candidate with Hyde's credentials - or lack thereof - shouldn't be taken seriously. Of course he would be a viable candidate for the Republican nomination.   But that's a far cry from winning. First-term U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes is theoretically the most vulnerable House member in Connecticut, and a number of more-legitimate Republican candidates are preparing to challenge her. But \"most competitive seat in Connecticut\" isn't saying much. In looking ahead to the U.S. House races for this fall,  it's   hard   to find  a single national prognosticator that has CT-5 on a map of key races.

Hawaiian Electric Co. said it has entered exploratory discussions with Pulama Lanai for its assets on Lanai, Hawaii's sixth- largest island.   The co-founder and chairman of Oracle Corporation already owns 98% of the island.   Pulama Lanai is investigating the purchase as a way to achieve a quicker transition from oil-based power to 100% renewable energy, the company said in a statement.   \"We are by far its largest customer and have a vested interest in building a modernized grid that will speed Lanai's progress toward being energy independent,\" the company said.   The purchase would result in lower electricity bills for about 3,000 island residents, who often pay more for electricity than most other Hawaii residents, Pulama Lanai said.   The December cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity was 41.1 cents on Lanai. The cost was 34.8 cents on Molokai, 33.8 cents on Hawaii island, 33.4 cents on Kauai, 30.3 cents on Maui, and 27.1 cents on Oahu, Hawaiian Electric said.   Pulama Lanai plans to include Lanai residents and other groups in purchase discussions.   A purchase would be subject to approval from the state Public Utilities Commission, which regulates electrical rates and would hold a public hearing on a transaction. A deal would also be analyzed by the state consumer advocate.   Ellison purchased the majority of Lanai in 2012 for about $300 million from the owner of agriculture and real estate company Castle & Cooke Inc.   Ellison has publicized his intention to make the island more economically and environmentally stable.", "keyword": "None"}

Kit Harington and Rose Leslie continued the Game of Thrones legacy at the 2020 Golden Globes and had a date night in the process, eight months after he sought treatment for personal issues. Golden Globes 2020 Red Carpet Fashion: What the Stars Wore The British actor, 33, is nominated for Actor in a Drama TV Series for Game of Thrones. While most of his fellow castmates were not in attendance at the awards show this year, his wife of more than one year was right by his side. The duo walked the red carpet and showed some PDA in a rare public outing on Sunday, January 5. Leslie, 32, wore a green, sequined gown while her husband sported a sleek suit on the carpet. Once inside, the couple stayed close and stopped at an outside bar. \u201cTheir arms were wrapped around each other and Rose kissed Kit on the cheek rapidly multiple times,\u201d an onlooker told Us Weekly. \u201cThey looked so in love.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t been to one of these things without the rest of us around,\u201d Harington told E! News on the Globes carpet. \u201cIt does go by fast. It was 10 years, like that. And, at the same time, not like that. It was this whole period of my life that\u2019s been a big thing to detach from, it\u2019s taking a little while.\u201d The lovebirds\u2019 award show appearance marks their second public outing in two months. In December 2019, the pair attended MS Society\u2019s Carols by Candlelight in London.

He was living a very unhealthy lifestyle,\u201d a source told Us exclusively at the time. \u201cHe was stressed all the time and using unhealthy coping tools.\u201d The source added: \u201c[Rose] loves him very much. She had been telling him to get into treatment for a little while now.\u201d A second insider echoed the statements and made it clear that the actor\u2019s wife was the biggest reason behind him getting back on track. \u201cRose was a driving force for him to seek help and better himself.

San Leandro mother Miesha Ellese Singleton, 40, was struck and  killed at 3:22 p.m. in the 1800 block of 98th Avenue, police said.   A newer-model white Nissan Maxima was recovered Monday in Oakland  and is believed to be the vehicle that struck Singleton, Oakland police  Officer Johnna Watson said.   Watson said police appreciate the tips from the community that led  officers to the vehicle, which Watson said was not stolen. Police are not  disclosing where they found the vehicle, at least not at this time.   Police are asking the driver of the Nissan to surrender and  they're also asking the community to provide information that might lead  investigators to the suspect. A $10,000 reward is being offered for tips that  lead to an arrest in the case, Watson said.   She said officers are working with the FBI and doing some DNA  testing. Monday evening at a vigil near the location where Singleton was  killed, her family asked for anyone with information about the driver to come  forward.   Anyone with information is asked to get in touch with the Police  Department's traffic investigation unit at (510) 777-8570.    Copyright \u00a9 2020 by Bay City News, Inc.

LOUIS - A rising star in the world of professional motocross racing, Theodore \"Bubba\" Pauli, of Edwardsville, as an athlete and a manager, will lead his team in round two of Monster Energy AMA Supercross' 2020 season.   The 17-round schedule for the 2020 season of Monster Energy AMA Supercross, a FIM World Championship, will have riders returning Saturday, Jan. 11, to fan-favorite market St. Louis at The Dome at America's Center.   Supercross features the world's most elite athletes chasing their dreams, like Pauli (450SX Class), on U.S. soil inside America's most well-known stadiums. Three first-time champions, Cooper Webb (450SX Class), Dylan Ferrandis (Western Regional 250SX Class) and Chase Sexton (Eastern Regional 250SX Class) will be eager to defend their titles against the rich field, including Pauli, Jason Anderson, Marvin Musquin, Eli Tomac, Chad Reed, Ken Roczen, Justin Barcia, Adam Cianciarulo (250SX Class), Justin Cooper (250SX Class) and Austin Forkner (250SX Class).   Fans, family and friends can spot Pauli on the Supercross track by his number - 282. Pauli turned pro at the end of 2013 and has dominated in motocross competitions ever since.   Pauli's best career result to date is an 18th place finish at the Seattle & San Diego 450 Supercross, in which he finished 47th overall in 2018, and he has qualified for more than 100 professional events. Last season, he completed all 17 rounds of the Supercross series and earned a top 20 450 Supercross finish.   Pauli also is an actual character in the Monster Energy Supercross 2 video game for Playstation and XBOX.   He began riding dirt bikes with a couple of friends as a child and eventually got his own bike when he was 10 years old.   \"I fell in love with the sport from there,\" recalled Pauli,...", "keyword": "None"}

(AP) - A former student at a private boarding school for girls in Connecticut says in a federal lawsuit that the school was negligent for allowing a former faculty member to sexually abuse her.   The suit filed Tuesday alleges the Westover School in Middlebury failed and refused to report the teacher and squash coach to child welfare authorities, suspend or fire him or to warn other girls and their families of the risk he posed.   It seeks unspecified damages.   The suit was filed by a woman who attended the school from 2003 until 2007 and said she was abused when she was 15.   The school is the sole defendant.   Westover's head of school, Julie Faulstich, said in a statement that she is aware of the suit. She pointed out that the faculty member was fired in 2008 when the allegations were reported to authorities.

On June 12, the governor signed into law the most progressive abortion law in the country. Titled the Reproductive Health Act - clearly it has nothing to do with reproduction, but only the killing of the unborn - the law repealed the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975. It eliminated felony penalties for doctors that perform abortions, removed waiting periods, and removed the requirement that a married woman get consent from her husband.   The bill established the \"fundamental right\" of a woman to have an abortion and said that a \"fertilized egg, embryo or fetus does not have independent rights.\" The law also requires that the cost of an abortion be treated like any other medical procedure for insurance purposes, including Medicaid.   Simply stated, your tax dollars are being used to kill a human baby in the womb.   This sweeping new law also removed necessary regulations and licensing requirements and eliminated the rights of unborn children.   The new law changed the definition of the viability of a fetus and legalized abortions through all nine months of pregnancy.   Here are five shocking facts about the new abortion law:   \u2022 All licensing requirements for abortion clinics are abolished, and health and safety inspections ended, despite those inspections shutting down numerous dirty abortion clinics in recent years.   \u2022 Dismemberment abortions of premature babies - who feel pain - without anesthesia, are legalized.   \u2022 Every private health insurance policy, including those for small churches and religious nonprofits, must pay for elective...", "keyword": "None"}

All five were nominated Tuesday for the top prize of both the Directors Guild Awards and the Producers Guild Awards, two of the most reliable Academy Awards bellwethers.   All but \"1917,\" which took top honors Sunday at the Golden Globes, have been nominated by the industry's leading three guild awards. The Screen Actors Guild earlier selected \"Once Upon a Time .. in Hollywood,\" \"Parasite,\" \"The Irishman\" and \"Jojo Rabbit\" for its biggest award, best ensemble.   Tuesday's rare confluence of announcements puts awards season into hyper speed. The Academy Awards moved up several weeks to Feb. 9 this year, squeezing the pre-Oscars calendar. The British Academy Film Awards also unveiled their nominations Tuesday, with \"Joker\" leading all films with 11 nods and an all-white acting field that immediately sparked criticism.   Oscar prognosticators pay particular attention to the Producers Guild, which selects 10 movies for the year. Aside from the above five films, the producers also nominated \"Joker,\" \"Marriage Story,\" \"Knives Out,\" \"Little Women\" and \"Ford v Ferrari\" for its annual top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award.   Producers Guild Awards, now in its 31st year, have a history of forecasting the Academy Awards. In 21 out of the last 30 years, the PGA winner has corresponded with the Academy Awards best picture winner, including the last two years: \"Green Book\" in 2019, \"The Shape of Water\" in 2018.

The Conroe Fly Fishers meet twice a month at the VA Clinic, 690 S Loop 336 W.   The local group is a program of a national nonprofit, Project Healing Waters Fly Fishing.   National spokesman Daniel Morgan explained that the first program started at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. in 2005. There are now 228 operations throughout the U.S., each managed by volunteers who work with the Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, Department of Defense military installations, Warrior Transition Units and other institutions.   Morgan was a volunteer at Project Healing for nine years before joining the staff - and he was already an avid fly fisher.   He explained that the program started as a way to get veterans outside of the hospital at Walter Reed.   \"There's an intrinsic healing quality of nature,\" Morgan said. \"These fish live in beautiful places.\"   He added that fly fishing itself can mimic traditional physical therapy. The practice requires concentration, fine motor skills and balance.   \"It's also a creative outlet,\" he said. \"You're making something, and you're working with your hands.\"   In addition, Project Healing Waters Fly Fishing meets on a regular basis, giving veterans a constant activity with like-minded friends who also love to fish.   \"We're offering a continuum of care,\" Morgan said. \"Helping a disable vet is not a one-time event.

April through June is likely to be wetter than normal in Illinois, according to rainfall projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, posing a challenge to corn and soybean farmers in the heart of planting season.   Right now those farmers are calculating their losses after suffering through the wettest January to June in state history last year.   Wettest of those months was May, which pushed planting of Illinois' top two crops into June and July, when in an ideal year they can be in the ground in April.   The result: Corn and soybean production dropped 18 percent and 20 percent, respectively, according to final yield numbers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   \"Farmers should expect to deal with an increased frequency of wet winters and springs,\" said Illinois' State Climatologist Dr. Trent Ford, who expects wetter-than-normal conditions to become routine.   After last weekend's rainstorms, Ford said all but far northwest Illinois has had above-average January precipitation with half the month still to go. NOAA also projects a wetter-than-average February and March.   \"The last couple of decades especially we've seen our winters be wetter than previous decades,\" Ford said. \"That doesn't mean more snow necessarily, it just means overall more precipitation.\"   For example, he says 20 of the past 25 winters in Peoria have been wetter than the city's 120-plus-year average.   \"Preparing for wetter-than-normal conditions to be more common or happen more frequently is something...", "keyword": "None"}

Most people - whether longtime residents or those here just for a visit - have had that moment when a picture-perfect blue sky, a sweeping shoreline vista, the silence of an old-growth forest or the sound of rushing water has taken their breath away.   This past year we celebrated these wondrous features of our state, and the people who gather amid them, during our state parks centennial.   Michigan state parks, forests, trails and waterways are at the core of the spirit of this Great Lakes state, and we are working hard to ensure that they endure for another century.   On May 12, 1919, the Michigan Legislature created the state parks system with the establishment of the Michigan State Parks Commission. This legislative act not only moved forward a vision to acquire lands to create quality public outdoor spaces but helped shape an important aspect of Michigan's heritage.   Our state parks fused together the public's desire for recreation, relaxation and rejuvenation with opportunities to make lasting memories - enjoying experiences outdoors with Michigan's spectacular scenic beauty as a backdrop.   A drive through Holly Recreation Area or Sleepy Hollow State Park evokes memories of Sunday afternoons and gingham picnic blankets. A hike along the path to the brink of the Tahquamenon Falls or a weekend spent on the soft sands in front of Ludington State Park's historic beach house may recall memories of special times spent with family and friends.   It's for this reason that the Michigan state parks centennial celebration centered around the personal memories and shared experiences that connect so many of us.   As the year closed, we had an opportunity to step back and ask what it will take to...", "keyword": "None"}

Such a move abroad, away from the strictures of Buckingham Palace and its many duties, would be bold and remarkable, signaling that two of the younger, more popular royals may be fed up with an anachronistic, cosseted life of endless ribbon-cutting and fusty, scripted engagements - and the scrutiny that comes with all of that.

Meghan, before becoming a royal, was best known for her role in the television legal drama \"Suits.\"   The globally famous couple - friends to Oprah Winfrey, Elton John, George Clooney and the Obamas - have complained bitterly of being pursued by the British tabloids.   They have filed lawsuits and given TV interviews claiming violations of their privacy.

But Hawks turnovers on three successive possessions and a clutch performance by Anna McKee brought overtime and the Father McGivney Griffins drew off to beat Carrollton 59-51 in a quarterfinal of the 46th annual Carrollton Invitational girls basketball tournament.   \"We fell under pressure and we shouldn't,\" Carrollton coach Blaine Hartwick said. \"We went away from what got us a lead in the third quarter and the first part of the fourth quarter. We gave them the ball and them made us pay.\"   McKee's steal and layup with 1:21 left in the fourth quarter drew the Griffins within 42-39. McKee followed another Carrollton turnover with a 3-pointer to tie it at 42 with 1:04 remaining. Neither team could score in the final 64 seconds - a Hawks jumper in the lane at the buzzer would not fall - and McGivney owned the OT.   \"It was really a gut-check for the girls and I'm happy with the way they responded,\" Griffins coach Jeff Oller said.   McGivney gets to 20 wins for the second season in a row. \"That's just a testament to how hard these girls worked,\" said Oller, whose 20-4 squad will play Class 3A Jersey (18-5) in a semifinal on Thursday night.   Carrollton saw its winning streak halted at eight in a row. The 17-5 Hawks will play rival Calhoun in a fifth-place semifinal on Friday.   \"It hurts,\" Hartwick said of losing to the Griffins in a matchup that could come again in a 1A sectional. \"But, hopefully, bigger picture, we learn a lesson and if that means we play again in the postseason, that will be a bigger game than what this one was.

(AP) - Christina Mauser poured her heart and soul into coaching and teaching physical education at the school where young Gianna and her basketball star father Kobe Bryant were an integral part of the community.   The mother of three worked at the campus in Newport Beach for more than a decade and helped lead its eighth-grade basketball team to its first championship, Harbor Day School said in a statement.   Bouquets were laid at the entrance to the campus Monday, a day after a helicopter carrying Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter, Mauser and six others to a youth basketball tournament crashed. Everyone aboard perished.   \"This loss is indescribable,\" the school said in the statement, describing Gianna as someone who never left anyone out, was mature beyond her years and had an unmatched work ethic, \"as is the loss of her father who was a respected and active member of the school community.\"   Harbor Day is a private school in the idyllic seaside community where Bryant lived. Mauser, of nearby Huntington Beach, taught and coached at the school from 2007 to 2018, the school said.   She and her husband Matt taught and coached basketball at the school, which is how they met Bryant, Matt Mauser told NBC's \"Today\" show.   She had a keen mind for defense, he said, and Bryant brought her on to help coach that skill at his Mamba Academy training facility where Gianna's club team played.   \"They called her the mother of defense: MOD,\" he said.   \"She was just an amazing person: beautiful, smart, funny,\" Mauser said. \"He didn't pick her because she was a slouch. He picked her because she was amazing.\"   At the school, some students arrived Monday wearing purple and gold, the colors of Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers.

Not yet anyway.   The Alton High boys basketball coach wouldn't concede that notion after a 65-56 Southwestern Conference loss to Belleville West on Friday that dropped the Redbirds to 9-7 overall and 1-4 in the conference.   The Redbirds were going well when they opened the Centralia Holiday Tournament with two wins to open bracket play to improve their record to 8-3 at the time. But consecutive losses to close the tournament has snowballed a bit into a 1-4 stretch the past five games.   \"I don't think it's gut check time,\" Morgan said. \"I just think for us, with us, tonight, we've been missing some guys to kind of get them back in the game, to incorporate Andrew [Jones] back after three and a half weeks. He's a little winded. Dante' [Herrin] back, he's a little winded. Moory [Woods] is dealing with some things, he's a little winded, so I just think for us, we have to continue to work. I don't think it's gut check time until it's the last game of the season.\"   The Redbirds are getting balanced scoring from Woods, a senior, who leads the way at 14.1 points per game, but he was held to seven against the Maroons, who picked up their first conference win on Friday (8-7, 1-3). Senior Ky'lun Rivers is averaging 13.1 ppg and led Alton with 13 on Friday, including 10 in the third quarter, and Herrin, a junior, is coming in at 10.8 ppg. Junior Ja'markus Gary is just under 10 points per game at 9.8 and sophomore Camren Edwards is hitting for 7.1 ppg.   But in each of Alton's past five games, they've allowed 65 points or more, and defensively, they're going to have to tighten it up, increase its pressure or limit the high percentage looks in order to win on a more consistent basis.

Several stars \u2014 including Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi, Jessica Simpson and Jessica Alba \u2014 have gone above and beyond to let their fans and loved ones know what the sex of their babies will be. Celebrity Babies of 2019 The formula is simple enough: Stuff a unique prop \u2014 think balls, balloons, pi\u00f1atas, desserts, boxes and more \u2014 with colored powder, confetti or frosting of a certain hue to signify the impending arrival of a little boy or a little girl. The execution of each A-lister, however, varies greatly from couple to couple. Where Ryan Lochte and Kayla Reid used a wrapped box filled with pink balloons to announce the news that their second child would be a girl, The Bachelorette\u2019s Melissa Rycroft and Tye Strickland opted for a cupcake filled with a blue frosting for their second little boy. Carly Waddell and Evan Bass and Jason Aldean and Brittany Kerr, meanwhile, used their big reveal as a chance to bring their families closer together. Bass\u2019 sons from a previous union, for instance, had a heck of a time hitting a pink confetti-filled pi\u00f1ata while Aldean\u2019s daughters took aim at baseballs enclosed with the secret of their newest sibling\u2019s sex. Ultimately, it\u2019s a moment of wonderment, shock and awe as each couple\u2019s future is decided in an instant. Jana Kramer\u2019s husband, Mike Caussin, even broke down in tears to learn that he would welcome his first son with the \u201cI Got the Boy\u201d singer after the musician suffered multiple miscarriages.

No American woman comes close to the repertoire of jumps the Liu, 14, possesses. She hit two triple axels among eight triples overall and attempted the only quad of the event, a lutz she under-rotated. Her 160.12 points by far exceeded the rest of the field and lifted her to 235.52 and up from second place after the short program. Skating last, Liu had little margin after Bell\u2019s superb skate. Bell knew after her final triple lutz, her seventh triple jump of the program, that she\u2019d put out the performance of her life. A huge smile spread across her face for the final half-minute as she flew across the ice with spirals and then her last spins. Bell\u2019s program was choreographed by 2018 U.S. Olympian Adam Rippon, who got the first hug from her as she left the ice to a standing ovation. But she simply didn\u2019t have the technical numbers to win her first national crown. Short program winner Bradie Tennell, the 2018 U.S. champ, has vastly improved her presentation, and she\u2019s usually the most precise of American female jumpers. Her fall on a triple loop not only was surprising, it dropped her to third place. Tennell landed six triples, all of them efficiently, and her program flowed nicely, with good pace and dynamic spins. It wasn\u2019t particularly exciting, but it was among her most interesting routines. Because Liu is too young to go to senior worlds, Bell and Tennell are likely to get the trip to Montreal in March.

And it's one they'll be needing.   Their 86-66 victory over the Lindenwood-Belleville junior varsity was indeed welcome. It ended a two-game skid that included losses to Vincennes University and Southwestern Illinois College. It also gives the Trailblazers a 12-5 record   heading into Saturday's 3 p.m. home game against Lincoln Trail.   The Saturday matchup is a game LCCC coach Doug Stotler calls \"the last game of the first round,\" since LTC is the only District 16 team the Trailblazers have yet to face. Following that game, LCCC will begin the second round - the second games of the season against the rest of District 16 teams.   \"I'm very happy at being 12-5 at this point in the season,\" Stotler said. \"We've got one more first-round game against Trail Saturday, then we really find out what we're made of.\"   Wednesday night, Stotler made full use of his bench, partly to give some of the players more game-time experience and to give others a rest. DeAngelo Ware and Jerry Jackson were held out of the lineup, nursing sore ankles.   \"It's nothing serious (Ware and Jackson),\" Stotler said, \"but this gave us a chance to let them rest a couple days.\"   Ware has a 10.8 points per game average and Jackson an 8.1 average.   The Trailblazers jumped out quickly against the Lynx. LCCC led 19-9 early and held a 45-20 halftime lead.   \"We played a lot of guys, but I wanted to give our starters some extended time on the court together, so we left them out there for the first 13 minutes,\" Stotler said. \"We worked on some things offensively.   \"Our defense wasn't really intense, but some of that could have been (Lindenwood).

(AP) - Connecticut is on track to end the current fiscal year with a $28 million budget deficit, state Comptroller Kevin Lembo has projected.   In a recent letter to Gov. Ned Lamont, Lembo said much of the projected deficit, about $24 million, stems from fewer than anticipated retirements of state employees. Lembo and Lamont are both Democrats.   The fiscal year ends on June 30.   Lembo's report to Lamont examined other aspects of Connecticut's economy, including housing, population and employment figures. He noted how sales of single-family homes declined 7.18% in November 2019, compared with November 2018, according to Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. New listings were down 7.15%, while the median listed price increased nearly 2% to $270,000.   His report also showed withholding receipts grew by 8.4% in fiscal year 2019, compared with the previous fiscal year. Lembo said that was \"especially significant\" because the withholding portion of the state's personal income taxes makes up the largest single revenue source for Connecticut's general fund, the state's main spending account.   Citing the state Department of Labor's preliminary Dec. 19 employment report, Lembo noted that Connecticut gained 900 net jobs in November, for a total of nearly 1.7 million. Connecticut has now recovered 85.5% of the jobs lost in the recession of 2008-10.   \"DOL notes that the three-month moving average job growth remains positive since July, but the annual growth rate of jobs remains modest,\" according to Lembo's report.   The report also cited U.S. Census Bureau data, which estimated that Connecticut's population declined by 6,623 people between 2018 and 2019, a small decrease compared with the prior year's estimate. The state's population now stands at 3.56 million.", "keyword": "None"}

Wigginton has been suspended, but his attorney has asked for a hearing to rescind the suspension.   In a related development, the Madison County State's Attorney's Office has asked for a special prosecutor in the case because Wigginton is a former Madison County assistant state's attorney.   In a petition for a hearing, attorney Curt Dawson said the purpose of such hearings, as provided by Illinois law, is to, among other things, determine whether Wigginton was in actual control of a motor vehicle and whether he did, in fact, refuse to submit to tests for presence of alcohol or drugs.   Under law, Wigginton has 30 days from the suspension to be heard by a judge on matters concerning the suspension. The Madison County State's Attorney's Office has no information on the case, since it has been turned over to a special prosecutor.   Wigginton received a ticket for driving under the influence on Dec. 27, his third such charge.   There has been long-reaching controversy concerning Wigginton's previous DUI charges.   In March, it was uncovered that an apparent mistake by the Madison County Circuit Clerk's Office allowed Wigginton to keep his driving privileges, as criminal proceedings in his second charge of driving under the influence play out.   Circuit Clerk Mark Von Nida said at the time he would implement changes to avoid such mistakes in the future.   Von Nida said his office is in charge of scheduling hearings that allow people whose license has been suspended to get their driving privileges restored. Wigginton, 56, of Troy, didn't receive a scheduled hearing before the set 30-day deadline defendants are promised.   \"I know how it looks, but I am...", "keyword": "None"}

(AP) - Christina Mauser poured her heart and soul into coaching and teaching physical education at the school where young Gianna and her basketball star father Kobe Bryant were an integral part of the community.   The mother of three worked at the campus in Newport Beach for more than a decade and helped lead its eighth-grade basketball team to its first championship, Harbor Day School said in a statement.   Bouquets were laid at the entrance to the campus Monday, a day after a helicopter carrying Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter, Mauser and six others to a youth basketball tournament crashed. Everyone aboard perished.   \"This loss is indescribable,\" the school said in the statement, describing Gianna as someone who never left anyone out, was mature beyond her years and had an unmatched work ethic, \"as is the loss of her father who was a respected and active member of the school community.\"   Harbor Day is a private school in the idyllic seaside community where Bryant lived. Mauser, of nearby Huntington Beach, taught and coached at the school from 2007 to 2018, the school said.   She and her husband Matt taught and coached basketball at the school, which is how they met Bryant, Matt Mauser told NBC's \"Today\" show.   She had a keen mind for defense, he said, and Bryant brought her on to help coach that skill at his Mamba Academy training facility where Gianna's club team played.   \"They called her the mother of defense: MOD,\" he said.   \"She was just an amazing person: beautiful, smart, funny,\" Mauser said. \"He didn't pick her because she was a slouch.

Anna Bateson, the Guardian's acting CEO, and Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer, shared the news in a joint statement and said the move was driven in part by their own newspaper's reporting on the urgency of climate change and a need to be true to the company's values - particularly, they said, as fossil fuel companies continue to use their power to influence policies that harm the planet. \"Our decision is based on the decades-long efforts by many in that industry to prevent meaningful climate action by governments around the world,\" Bateson and Nicklin said. The policy takes effect immediately and applies to the Guardian's flagship paper in Britain; its American and Australian digital imprints, the Observer and Guardian Weekly print publications and all Guardian digital applications. Company leaders admitted that the ban on fossil fuel advertising will test the company financially, although it wasn't immediately clear how much of a hit to revenue the new policy will account for; last year, 40% of the company's revenue came from advertising. The Guardian's leaders also said they hope their decision will attract new, like-minded advertising partners and reader support and potentially balance the loss of revenue from the fossil fuel industry ban. The new policy will not apply to what are considered high carbon-emitting industries, such as car manufacturing and travel. The Guardian said the decision to keep advertising with such industries may disappoint some readers, but ending those partnerships would be a \"severe financial blow\" that could...", "keyword": "None"}

Soto Ready Mix, a small Houston company, had planned to build a concrete batch plant near homes and a park in Acres Homes, a historically black neighborhood in northwest Houston. Armando Soto, who owns property in a residential area on De Soto Street and operated logistics and storage at the site for his small family business, found himself caught in a bitter fight with neighbors who diligently fought to stop the company from obtaining an environmental permit to open a batch plant that, for some, would literally be next door. Soto has said he chose the site, which is next to homes and across the street from a community park, because it was near his home on the other side of U.S. 290. After the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality granted a hearing to the residents opposing the plant, allowing them to argue their case before a state administrative judge, Soto agreed to withdraw the permit application rather than proceed with the contested hearing, which was scheduled for Thursday. Instead, elected officials negotiated with the Soto family and their attorney Thursday morning, in which Soto agree to find a new site for the batch plant outside of Acres Homes and reduce current industrial activity at the site.

Beardstown Fire Department received a call around 7 a.m. Monday about a residential fire in the 1300 block of Washington Street. With help from the Arenzville Fires Department, they were able to contain the fire to the one home, Beardstown Fire Chief Brian Becker said.   Becker said the family that was living in the house - Ryan and Nicole Wessel and their children, Trent, 12; and Les, 19 - managed to get out unharmed and without assistance. The fire department still is investigating the cause of the fire, which Becker said resulted in a lot of smoke damage.   According to a GoFundme account set up by Christopher Krohe, the son of the Wessels' landlords, the house will need to be torn down and the Wessels do not have renter's insurance.   Krohe said the fire started in the bathroom and everyone in the family was asleep when the house started to fill with smoke. Parts of the fence the Wessels shared with Krohe's parents had to be torn down so firefighters could better access the scene. Krohe said his father already has worked to temporarily fix the fence and got part of the house boarded up.    The Gofundme  was set up to help the Wessels pay for housing and to replace what they lost in the blaze. Immediate needs include clothing, though furniture and other household necessities also will be needed. The family also lost all of its Christmas presents.   The Gofundme page has a goal of $5,000; as of Friday afternoon, $180 has been raised from six donations.", "keyword": "None"}

G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez disappeared Jan. 13, sending a shock wave through communities of environmental conservationists in the United States and Mexico. Local authorities created search teams and the state attorney general launched an investigation. Almost immediately, his fellow activists suspected loggers and criminal groups whom G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez may have upset in his conservation efforts.   G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez was found floating in a well near the butterfly sanctuary he had spent decades working to preserve, according to Miguel Angel Cruz, who succeeded G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez as commissioner of the community of El Rosario. The cause of death is not yet known.   In an interview with The Washington Post last month at the El Rosario Monarch Butterfly preserve, G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez spoke about his efforts - and the challenges he faced as he tried to protect the migrating butterflies.   \"It's been a fight to maintain it,\" he said. \"And it hasn't been easy.\"   For as long as anyone can remember, millions of monarch butterflies have spent their winters on a few remote hilltops in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n. But logging in the region nearly destroyed their habitat, a convergence of geography and landscape that may be impossible to replicate.   The Mexican government eventually outlawed logging in the area, giving new life to the monarch butterflies, even as it created enormous tension between local loggers and conservationists. Between 2005 and 2006, 461 hectares in the region were lost to illegal logging.   G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez spoke openly about growing up in a logging family that was initially skeptical about the...", "keyword": "None"}

Gori, hid out in a wooded area near the victim's home before he was arrested, a police officer said at a news conference Monday.   Authorities charged Timothy M. Banowetz, 28, of Wentzville with three counts of first degree murder, three counts of theft, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and unlawful restraint. He is being held in the Madison County Jail without bond.   \"The defendant can best be described as having a transient and nomadic lifestyle,\" Capt. David Vucich of the Madison County Sheriff's Office said at a packed news conference in the Madison County Administration Building Monday. \"In my 22-year career as a law enforcement official, I have seen a lot of gruesome cases. But this one elevates to the top of heinous and senseless crimes.\"   The charges claim Banowetz bound two victims and fatally stabbed Gori with a knife. He allegedly stole cash and two cell phones from his victims.   Vucich said the case is still under investigation and urged anyone with information to contact the sheriff's office at 618-296-5544 or 618-692-4433. He said the crime was pre-meditated, but authorities have not established a clear connection between Gori and Banowetz.   The theft and unlawful restraint charges involve two minors at Gori's home in the 4500 block of Mooney Creek Road, just outside of Edwardsville.

(AP) - Illinois could lighten its property tax burden by consolidating governmental taxing districts, standardizing property-value assessments, tightening up the appeals process and reining in breaks on commercial redevelopments, according to a draft report obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.   The unpublished report, required by state law signed last summer by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, found that Illinois hauls in $30 billion a year, or 38% of the total taxes collected, from a system put in place when the state was founded on its agricultural economy. Now it's best known as the nation's next-to-costliest, behind New Jersey .   \"Where an owner's land value was once a reasonable proxy for the land owner's ability to generate income to pay taxes, today most jobs and most household income are removed from any direct connection with the land,\" the report said. \"... Families are constantly questioning whether they are able to afford the property taxes and stay in their homes.\"   It's at least he fifth report of its kind since 1982.

On Wednesday at 2:12 a.m., officers with the Palo Alto Police  Department responded to a report of a commercial burglary that occurred at  the Bloomingdale's at the shopping center at 180 El Camino Real.   Security personnel at the center saw a person running to a parked  vehicle outside the Bloomingdale's and then speeding away with the vehicle's  lights off.   Surveillance video of the burglary showed a suspect using rocks to  smash open the east entrance glass door of the store, police said.   At least two suspects entered the store and used rocks to smash  numerous display cases.   The suspects then stole watches and jewelry from the store before  exiting the store.   The suspects then sped away in what appeared to be a 1990s white  four-door BMW 3 Series.   Police said an estimated $83,000 in merchandise was taken during  the burglary.   Investigators are looking into whether the burglary is related to  other similar burglaries that have occurred in surrounding cities.    Copyright \u00a9 2020 by Bay City News, Inc.

As that idea is weighed, Town Manager Robert Geiger is seeking input from town residents, according to the release.                   Geiger said the project would be 80 percent funded through federal reimbursement, while 20 percent of the project would be paid for with town funds.                   If the effort moves forward, construction on the Mad River-spanning bridge would likely begin in 2022 or 2023, he said in the release.                   In the release, Geiger noted \"that local and state policies encourages information on such projects be provided to citizens early,\" and suggested that residents raise any potential concerns early in the planning process.                   Those seeking additional information can contact Jim Rollins, town public works director, at 860-379-4070, Geiger said.                   Geiger said federal aid for the project has already been authorized under the  Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act , which was signed into law in 2012 and is administered by the Federal Highway Administration and the Connecticut Department of Transportation.                                       william.lambert@hearstmediact.com", "keyword": "None"}

Miles and signed two-way player Anzejs Pasecniks to a multiyear contract before Sunday's game against the Utah Jazz. The Wizards's leading scorer, Bradley Beal, also returned after missing five games with soreness in his lower right leg. The Jazz's leading scorer, Donovan Mitchell, was out with an illness. Miles had not played since late November after having surgery on his left wrist. He was averaging 6.4 points and 16 minutes per game. Pasecniks has averaged 8.2 points and 6.2 rebounds since signing a two-way contract with Washington on Dec. 18. The Wizards also inked Johnathan Williams to a two-way deal. Beal was in the starting lineup for the first time since New Year's Day for Washington, which also welcomed center Thomas Bryant back after he missed 20 games with a foot injury. Mitchell sat out his first game of the season after playing through illness on Friday. The result was a season-low four points \u2014 his first total below double figures \u2014 on 2-of-9 shooting. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "keyword": "None"}
